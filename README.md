Personal site for blogging, experiments, etc..

Right now this site is an experiment in building a
[PWA](https://web.dev/progressive-web-apps/)
[Github Page](https://pages.github.com/)
with
[Preact](https://preactjs.com/),
[TypeScript](https://github.com/preactjs-templates/typescript),
and
[Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/).
Automated tests written using [preact-testing-library](https://testing-library.com/docs/preact-testing-library/intro/).
