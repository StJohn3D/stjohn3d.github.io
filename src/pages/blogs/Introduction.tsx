    ~

    My love for animation and gaming somehow led me to pursuing a BA in Computer Animation.

    While in college I met two artists who were using mel scripting and GML to do some amazing things with their art.

    So I decided to step up my game and learn to code too.

    I absolutely fell in love with coding.

    It's an art-form that produces something useful! Which is so much more rewarding than the brief moments someone will spend admiring a drawing.

    Of course, my absolute favorite projects are ones that bring all my talents together.

    That's why my dream is to one day be a full-time indie game developer.

    That, and to create an AI which can pass the Turing test.

    I really want to right a program which can simulate the human mind.
